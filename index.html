			WEEK 8: INJURY UPDATE 
		</b>
	</br> 
			Here are the top injuries to report from this week and the players who will likely benifit from the injuries.  Starting at the quarterback position, it appears that QB Alex smith will sit 
			out week 9 with a concussion which leaves backup, Nick Foles, at the helm of the Chiefs offense. Also, it appers that Steelers QB, Ben Roethlisberger will return this week after sitting out
			week 7 and having his bye week 8.  In the running back department, it appears DeMarco Murray is nursing a toe injury so watch for rookie, Heisman trophy winner
			Derrick Henry to pick up some of the workload.  Charcandrick West also looks to have a big week due to the fact that Jamaal Charles has been placed on Injured
			Reserve and fill-in Spencer Ware will most likely sit out of Week Nine's contest against a weak Jacksonville run defenese with a concussion. In the wide reciever
			department look for slot reciever, Randall Cobb to return to action against a struggling Colts secondary.  Some of the leagues top recievers such as Amari Cooper, Larry Fitzgerald,
			T.Y. Hilton, and Odell Beckham Jr. are all battling with injuries but they should all be good to go for week nine barring any significant setbacks.  Finally, Falcon's tight
			end Jacob Tamme will be out this Thursday night with a shoulder injury so look for backup TE Austin Hooper to handle the workload.  This is your week 8 injury report.  Check back
			next week for the latest injury news.
